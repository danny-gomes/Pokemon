If both Pokémon on the same side of the field use this move on the same turn  the Pokémon that uses it last will become the target.  This effect takes priority over lightning rod and storm drain.  If the user's ally switches out  opposing Pokémon may still hit it with pursuit.  This move cannot be selected by assist or metronome.
