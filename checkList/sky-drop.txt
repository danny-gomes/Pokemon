Description: Inflicts regular damage.  User carries the target high into the air for one turn  during which no moves will hit either Pokémon and neither can act.  On the following turn  the user drops the target  inflicting damage and ending the effect.  If the target is flying-type  this move will function as normal but inflict no damage.  gust  hurricane  sky uppercut  smack down  thunder  twister  and whirlwind can hit both the user and the target during this effect.  gust and twister will additionally have double power.  The damage from hail and sandstorm still applies during this effect.  Either Pokémon may be hit during this effect if also under the effect of lock on  mind reader  or no guard.  This move cannot be used while gravity is in effect.  This move cannot be selected by sleep talk.  *Bug*: If gravity is used during a double or triple battle while this move is in effect  this move is not correctly canceled on the target  and it remains high in the air indefinitely.  As this move prevents the target from acting  the only way to subsequently remove it from the field is to faint it.
