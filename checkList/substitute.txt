Description: Transfers 1/4 the user's max HP into a doll that absorbs damage and causes most negative move effects to fail.  If the user leaves the field  the doll will vanish.  If the user cannot pay the HP cost  this move will fail.  The doll takes damage as normal  using the user's stats and types  and will break when its HP reaches zero.  Self-inflicted damage from confusion or recoil is not absorbed.  Healing effects from opponents ignore the doll and heal the user as normal.  Moves that work based on the user's HP still do so; the doll's HP does not influence any move.  The doll will block major status effects  confusion  and flinching.  The effects of smelling salts and wake up slap do not trigger against a doll  even if the Pokémon behind the doll has the appropriate major status effect.  Multi-turn trapping moves like wrap will hit the doll for their regular damage  but the multi-turn trapping and damage effects will not activate.  Moves blocked or damage absorbed by the doll do not count as hitting the user or inflicting damage for any effects that respond to such  e.g.  avalanche  counter  or a rowap berry.  magic coat still works as normal  even against moves the doll would block.  Opposing Pokémon that damage the doll with a leech move like absorb are healed as normal.  It will also block acupressure  block  the curse effect of curse  dream eater  embargo  flatter  gastro acid  grudge  heal block  leech seed  lock on  mean look  mimic  mind reader  nightmare  pain split  psycho shift  spider web  sketch  swagger  switcheroo  trick  worry seed  and yawn.  A Pokémon affected by yawn before summoning the doll will still fall to sleep.  The doll blocks intimidate  but all other abilities act as though the doll did not exist.  If the user has an ability that absorbs moves of a certain type for HP (such as volt absorb absorbing thunder wave)  such moves will not be blocked.  life orb and berries that cause confusion still work as normal  but their respective HP loss and confusion are absorbed/blocked by the doll.  The user is still vulnerable to damage inflicted when entering or leaving the field  such as by pursuit or spikes; however  the doll will block the poison effect of toxic spikes.  The doll is passed on by baton pass.  It keeps its existing HP  but uses the replacement Pokémon's stats and types for damage calculation.  All other effects work as normal.
