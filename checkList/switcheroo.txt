Description: User and target permanently swap held items.  Works even if one of the Pokémon isn't holding anything.  If either Pokémon is holding mail  this move will fail.  If either Pokémon has multitype or sticky hold  this move will fail.  If this move results in a Pokémon obtaining choice band  choice scarf  or choice specs  and that Pokémon was the latter of the pair to move this turn  then the move it used this turn becomes its chosen forced move.  This applies even if both Pokémon had a choice item before this move was used.  If the first of the two Pokémon gains a choice item  it may select whatever choice move it wishes next turn.  Neither the user nor the target can recover its item with recycle.  This move cannot be selected by assist or metronome.
